Yuna Lee, 

I was born in South Korea, and lived there until 1st grade. Then i moved to San Jose, CA and started from 2nd grade. Lastly I moved to San Diego and started middle school. Even though I lived in US for a long time, Korean is more confortable for me. Some of my hobbies are to play bass guitar, crochet and watch movies. An interesting fact about me is that in middle school, I was in the school band playing tuba. My birthday is august 27 2010 so I'm almost always the youngest in the class.

I'm really excited to learn new things in the Class!
