    "##### Reflection:\n",
    "- Even though I wasn't able to finish the game, I've learned different aspects of game and how games are made. \n",
    "    - To improve Myself, I should try making a game even if it isn't for a grade since it would really help me understand and get used to javascript.\n",
    "- In the Night At the Museum, by looking at other peoples' codes and ideas of the different games, I was able to improve my game better.\n",
    "- Since one of my strengths are to be able to use the aspects that I learned very effectively, I should search up all the things I don't know or understand to actually make me used to using the aspects.\n",
    "- Some of the weaknesses that I have is having a hard time to debug the errors and finding out what each errors are which is essential in coding. \n",
    "    - What I could do to improve this is by doing more and more projects\n",
    "- Some of my after plans are to take CSEE 2, helping myself to understand the concepts better than in CSSE 1. \n",
    "    - Things I could do to make that happen is by more actively working in the class, making a list of what I should do in the next class time. \n",
    "    - I'm sure this would help me a lot because there would be less time that I would waste. \n",
    "- By learning how to code and the details of coding, I would later be able to use it in the future for colleges and jobs.\n",
    "    - Even if I don't attempt for a computer science major in college, It would help me a lot in any computer related majors becuase It develops my understanding of computer itself and how the codings work.\n",
    "#### Self Grade: \n",
    "I would give myself 4/5 on my final grade because even though the game is the most important part of the finals, I wasn't able to finish one of the tinkers."
