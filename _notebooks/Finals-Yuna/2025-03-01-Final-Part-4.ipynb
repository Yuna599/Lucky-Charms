    "This game has a wonderful storyline and really encourages the player to work hard in order to reach the end of the game! Although the game is unfinished, I can tell that by the game is 'finished' (has an ending) it will be a very good and cute game. 10/10 game, I'm excited to see where it goes."

    "I like how there is a storyline with your game and there is a quest to do something! I also liked the use of sound effects, like when you interact with the sword guardian. Make sure to try to get the gym to work and point out the \"go to gym\" button, because I didn't even notice it until you pointed it out. I think if you finished the story, it would enhance the game even more, too. Good job on what you have so far, though!\n",
