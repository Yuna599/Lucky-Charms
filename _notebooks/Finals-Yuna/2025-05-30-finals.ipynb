    "At the beginning of this CSSE class, I honestly felt a little lost. Everyone seemed to know what they were doing — GitHub, terminal commands, writing methods — while I was still trying to figure out how to run the program at all. But what made this class special for me was the people I worked with. I didn’t just learn programming. I learned how to lean on my team.\n",
    "\n",
    "I had moments where I was stuck, completely unsure what to do next. That’s where my group stepped in. Whether it was helping me figure out a broken branch or explaining what a pull request actually does, they were patient and explained things in ways I could understand. Eventually, I stopped being afraid to ask for help — and started finding confidence in giving help back.\n",

    "Branch: A separate line of development in Git that doesn’t affect the main code until merged.\n",
    "------------------\n",
    "Our group worked together to plan, build, and test different projects. We started using GitHub to track versions of our code, and I learned how to use branches to safely try new ideas without messing up the main project. I didn’t understand how merging worked at first — and yes, I broke the main branch once. But I learned how to fix it, how to test before I push, and how to write better commit messages. We also learned about deployment: seeing our projects actually live online felt real.\n",

    "At first, I was nervous about code reviews — what if someone pointed out something I completely missed? But over time, I saw how useful those conversations were. I got better at receiving feedback and also giving it. Our retrospectives helped us reflect on what went well and what needed to change. Presenting live demos also pushed me out of my comfort zone and helped me grow in confidence, not just as a coder, but as a communicator.\n",

    "-------------\n",
    "We covered essential data types like numbers, strings, booleans, arrays, and JSON objects. These might sound basic, but they’re the building blocks of everything we did. I learned how to use operators to combine strings or perform calculations, and how to use boolean logic in control structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before this class, I didn’t really get how loops or if statements worked. But writing games and apps using control structures like for loops and if/else helped it finally click.\n",

    "\n",
    "Numbers: Numeric values like integers or decimals.\n",

    "One part I really enjoyed was learning how to make web pages interactive. We used HTML forms to get input from users and JavaScript to check the input or respond when someone pressed a key. Working with the DOM made it easy to update the page based on what the user did, which made the projects feel more practical and hands-on compared to just using the console.\n",

    "---------------\n",
    "Classes were confusing to me at first. Writing a class, adding methods, instantiating objects. But after enough repetition and support from my group, I finally understood how to use them. We created objects with different behaviors and properties, and I saw how powerful it is when you structure your code cleanly.\n",

    "\n",
    "Instantiation: The process of creating an object from a class.\n",
    "--------\n",
    "One of the biggest takeaways from this year was the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) — making sure each class or function only has one job. We also learned about Object Literals and how they differ from Instances. I especially enjoyed learning how to build FSMs (Finite State Machines) for games. Using inheritance was something I struggled with but started to grasp as the year went on.\n",

    "\n",
    "During the night at the museum, I was able to look around the other teams and the csp and csa students, getting inspired by them. few people came to our group and I told them how our game worked and how we made it to work. Most of the feedbacks they gave us were that we did good knowing that we are in the csse class. They also liked the chicken in our platformer game that bounces the player when it collides together.\n",

    "Self Grade\n",
    "I would give myself 90% on the dot. Even though I got a lot of help from the teammates, I understood all the concepts taught in the class. Lastly I tried my best to create the independent game, being able to understand most of the functions used in making a game. \n",
