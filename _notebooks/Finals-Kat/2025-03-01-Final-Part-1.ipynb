    "## 5 things I learned over this tri!\n",
    "\n",
    "1. I learned how to work together as a team. A lot of work throughout this tri was team or partner projects and I learned that in order for things to go smoother and easier we need to communicate and collaborate well as a team. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. During the lessons that we taught I also learned a lot about my own lesson, conditionals, because I was able to research it alot by myself. But I also learned alot about other lessons like nested conditionals, booleans and arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. I also learned that I need to have a good time managment. Alot of the times I would cram my projects until the very last minute and a lot of problems came up that I couldve fixed before if I was more careful. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. I learned how sprites work. I had a very fun time drawing the sprites because I got to see a more creative and artistic side of computer science and not the very techinical part. I learned that you have to draw each side of the npc so it will be able to move in the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. I also learned how to use other peoples feedback. During Night at the Museum we got lots of feedback on our game and how to improve it but at first I took it at insults. Now, I learned that feedback is meant to be helpful and help our game improve."
